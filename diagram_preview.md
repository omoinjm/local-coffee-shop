## Draw.io Diagram Example

To embed a Draw.io diagram (`.drawio` file) in a Markdown document, you typically need to export it to an image format (like SVG, PNG, or JPG) first. Then, you can embed that image using standard Markdown image syntax.

**Steps to Embed a Draw.io Diagram:**
1. Open your `aws-architecture.drawio` file in Draw.io.
2. Go to `File > Export as > SVG...` (or PNG/JPG).
3. Save the exported image (e.g., `aws-architecture.drawio.svg`) in your project directory (or an `images` subdirectory).
4. Reference the exported image in your Markdown file as shown below.

**Example (after exporting `aws-architecture.drawio` to `aws-architecture.drawio.svg`):**

![AWS Architecture Diagram](aws-architecture.drawio.svg)

*(Note: The image above will only display correctly after you have manually exported `aws-architecture.drawio` to `aws-architecture.drawio.svg` and placed it in the same directory as this Markdown file, or adjusted the path accordingly.)*
